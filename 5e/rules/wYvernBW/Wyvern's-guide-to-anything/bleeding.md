# Bleeding

<<<<<<< HEAD
When you make an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage against a creature, you wound the creature, making it bleed. The creature takes 1d4 damage on their subsequent turns. Healing, rests and succesful medicine checks with a DC = 10 + proficiency bonus + STR/DEX modifier (based on the weapon used).
=======
When a creature makes an attack that deals slashing or piercing damage that's greater than your number of hit dice faces (eg. 8 for a d8 at level 1, 16 for 2d8 at level 2), you start bleeding. On your subsequent turns you take half of the weapon used damage dice (eg. you have a d6 as a hit dice and you take 7 damage from a dagger, you will take an additional 2 damage on subsequent turns). Healing, rests and succesful medicine checks (DC is up to the DM's discretion) removes this effect.
