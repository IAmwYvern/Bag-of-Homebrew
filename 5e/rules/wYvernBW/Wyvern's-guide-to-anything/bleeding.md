# Bleeding

When a creature makes an attack that deals slashing or piercing damage that's greater than your number of hit dice faces (eg. 8 for a d8 at level 1, 16 for 2d8 at level 2), you start bleeding. On your subsequent turns you take half of the weapon used damage dice (eg. you have a d6 as a hit dice and you take 7 damage from a dagger, you will take an additional 2 damage on subsequent turns). You have disatvantage on any constitution checks to keep concentration on spells. Healing, rests and succesful medicine checks (DC is up to the DM's discretion) removes this effect.
