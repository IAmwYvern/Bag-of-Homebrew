# Bleeding

When you make an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage against a creature, you wound the creature, making it bleed. The creature takes 1d4 damage on their subsequent turns. Healing, rests and successful medicine checks with a DC = 10 + proficiency bonus + STR/DEX modifier (based on the weapon used).
