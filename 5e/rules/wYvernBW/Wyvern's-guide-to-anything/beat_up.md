# Beat Up

When you make an attack that deals bludgeoning damage against a creature, the creature becomes limp. The creature has decreased move speed equal to your strength modifier or twice your strength modifier if the attack is made with a two-handed weapon. This effect ends after 3 rounds, but can also be ended by healing and rests.
