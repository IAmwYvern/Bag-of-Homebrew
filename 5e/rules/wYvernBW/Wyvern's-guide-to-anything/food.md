# Food
Food in Dungeons & Dragons is a very broad topic, that is often overlooked. Sure there are rules about how much a player character can live without food and how much you would pay to buy different types of food but what if I wanted to become a D&D chef? There are pretty much no rules about cooking. Cooking utensils exist but there aren't any rules about using them and what you can cook with them. 

First, you must have proficiency on cook's utensils to add your proficiency bonus to the roll but you must also have proficiency on cooking that specific dish. You can cook a simple dish 3 times to get proficiency on it. You need to cook a mastery dish 10 times to get proficiency on it. Cooking a simple dish does not require making an ability check, unless the dish description says otherwise or your DM requires you to make a check. 

## Simple dishes
These are some dishes that anyone with a bit of experience can cook, given the material and time requirements. If you are interrupted during cooking you automatically fail.

### Fried chiken 
Any part of a chicken, fried over a stove or campfire.
requirements: materials (1/2 pound of chicken), 15 minutes.

### Mashed potatoes 
Boiled potatoes, mashed.
requirements: materials (1/2 pound of potatoes per person), 10 minutes (chopped potatoes) or 20 minutes (whole potatoes)

### Green Sauce
A very popular sauce with a yellowish green flavour. 
requirements: materials (1 cup parsley, 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup mint, 4 slices bread), 10 minutes 

* Requires another dish to go along with.
