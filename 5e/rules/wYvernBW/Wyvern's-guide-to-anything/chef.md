# Chef
'And as she sprinkled the never seen before condiment, the food glowed a bright orange as her companions ate it they felt rejuvenated like never before and as she said "Enjoy the food!" their wounds completely healed.' To put your heart into the art of cooking until it reaches perfection and using magic to your advantage. That is the art of the chef.

## Spellcasting

### Cantrips
As a chef you automatically know the firebolt and create firebolt cantrips. Additionally you learn another cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list at 10th level and 14th level.

### Spellcasting Ability
Your spellcasting ability modifier is wisdom. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a chef spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
 
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier

### Spellcasting Focus
You must use a set of cooking utensils as a spellcasting focus in order to cast chef spells.

### Spells known
As a chef you don't know any 1st or higher level spells. You instead use your spell slots to imbue your food with mystical flavours. See Mystical Flavors for help.

## Mystical Flavors 
You know a number of Mystical Flavors equal to your Wisdom modifier + your chef level (Minimum of one spell) from the [ Chef Mystical Flavors ]( Mystical-Flavors.md ) list.
