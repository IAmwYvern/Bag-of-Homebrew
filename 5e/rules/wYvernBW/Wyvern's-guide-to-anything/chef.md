## Spellcasting

### Cantrips
As a chef you automatically know the firebolt and create firebolt cantrips. Additionally you learn another cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list at 10th level and 14th level.

### Spellcasting Ability
Your spellcasting ability modifier is wisdom. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a chef spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
 
**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier  
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your wisdom modifier

### Spellcasting Focus
You must use a set of cooking utensils as a spellcasting focus in order to cast chef spells.

### Spells known
As a chef you don't know any 1st or higher level spells. You instead use your spell slots to imbue your food with mystical flavours. See Mystical Flavors for help.

## Mystical Flavors 
You know a number of Mystical Flavors equal to your Wisdom modifier + your chef level (Minimum of one spell) from the [ Chef Mystical Flavors ]( Mystical-Flavors.md ) list.

## Magical Cooking 
Starting at 2nd level you can spend one spell slot to instantly create one magical dish in front of you. You can give the food one of the following properties:
* you make the food glow one color of your choice. A creature who eats the food also glows in that light. The glowing creature sheds bright light in a 10 ft. radius.
* You give the food one taste of your choice, regardless of the ingredients used. 
* A creature who eats the food must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be charmed for 1 minute.
* A creature who eats the food removes one level of exhaustion.
